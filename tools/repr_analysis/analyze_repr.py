"""
analyze_repr.py - Representation analysis for LeWM / SWM checkpoints.

The analysis now treats representation quality in three layers:

1. embedding
   anti-collapse / capacity usage
2. prediction and rollout
   can the model predict the next latent, and does autoregressive rollout drift
   when driven by real action sequences from the dataset
3. planning
   does the model's own cost function assign lower cost to expert futures than
   to random action futures for the same start and goal

Optional:
4. reference_probe
   if `state_key` is provided, compare latent geometry to that external proxy.
   This is a probe only, not the main judge of representation quality.
